            </picture> <strong>Ayrton Senna</strong> was a renowned Formula 1 driver, considered the greatest Brazilian motorsport idol. Born in São Paulo on March 21, 1960, he tragically died on May 1, 1994, during the San Marino Grand Prix in Imola. His funeral, one of the most significant in Brazil's history, lasted about 22 hours and was attended by approximately 240,000 people.
            Senna was the son of Milton Teodoro Guirado da Silva and Neide Senna, and had a sister, Viviane Senna, who is the president of the <strong>Ayrton Senna</strong> Institute and mother of former Formula 1 driver Bruno Senna. Ayrton married Lilian Vasconselos in 1981, but the marriage lasted only a year. He dated personalities like Xuxa Meneghel and Carol Alt, and was in a relationship with Adriane Galisteu when he passed away. <strong>Ayrton Senna</strong> had no children.
            
            His motorsport career began in karting, encouraged by his father who built his first kart when he was four years old. Ayrton started competing professionally at the age of 13, quickly standing out. He won several karting titles, including the São Paulo Championship and the Brazilian Championship, in addition to South American competitions. Although he did not win the world karting title, he considered his competition with Englishman Terry Fullerton the best memory of his career, valuing the purity of the competition without the influence of politics or money.</p>

        <section >
            <p>In the early 1980s, <strong>Ayrton Senna</strong> faced an important career decision. He was studying Business Administration to manage his family's business with his father but was unhappy with this future. Senna wanted to pursue motorsport, move to England, and compete in major championships. His parents understood and decided to support his dream.
            Moving to England was craquamarineucial for Senna's development. He spent a year testing formula cars at the Snetterton circuit in Norwich while continuing to compete in karting. At that time, not every kart driver aspired to transition to formula cars, but Senna made it clear that it was his goal.
            
            Senna's talent attracted sponsors, and in 1981, he entered Formula Ford 1600, competing for Van Diemen Racing. He won the championship in his first year, winning most of the races. His performance was so impressive that Ralph Firman, the head of Van Diemen, predicted that Senna would one day be a Formula 1 world champion.
            
            Despite his success in Formula Ford 1600, Senna had to return to Brazil due to a lack of sponsorship for the following year. While working at his father's company, he received a call from Ralph Firman inviting him to compete in Formula Ford 2000. Although the financial offer was not lucrative, Senna needed to race again.
            
            The Formula 2000 car was more aggressive than the Formula 1600, particularly with its aerofoil. Nevertheless, Senna quickly adapted, winning 13 out of 15 races and securing another championship.</p>

            <h2 id="formula3">Senna's carrer in Formula 3</h2>
            <p>Champion in both Formula Ford 1600 and Formula Ford 2000, <strong>Ayrton Senna</strong>'s next step was to compete in British Formula 3, considered the gateway to Formula 1 at the time. The invitation to test a Formula 3 car came from Irish motorsport figure Eddie Jordan, who would later have his own Formula 1 team. In the test, Senna was faster than the team's current driver.

            Senna's first Formula 3 race was in 1982, while he was still racing in Formula Ford 2000. He was invited by West Surrey Racing to compete at Thruxton. The race was televised, giving Senna a great opportunity to attract sponsors. He secured pole position, won the race, and set the fastest lap, leading to a contract for the next season.
            
            The 1983 Formula 3 Championship was a contest between Senna and Martin Brundle, an English driver who would also reach Formula 1. Brundle drove for Eddie Jordan. Senna won most of the races and claimed the championship. Eddie Jordan remarked that Senna had a way of setting an incredible pace in the first few laps, which unsettled his opponents.
            
            Senna's achievements in single-seaters caught the attention of Formula 1 teams. In 1983, before winning the Formula 3 championship, he was invited to test for Williams, one of the top teams. Senna broke the track record at Donington Park, leaving the team "astonished," according to team principal Frank Williams. Ironically, Senna would die driving a Williams 11 years later.
            
            Also in 1983, Senna took two laps in a McLaren car, invited by team principal Ron Dennis. Years later, Senna and Ron Dennis would form one of the most successful partnerships in Formula 1 history.</p>

        <p>Despite his prom'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serifising test results with Williams and McLaren, it was risky for top teams to hire a young driver as a main pilot. Senna spoke with Lotus, a mid-level team at the time, but the only official offer came from the small team Toleman. "It was better to sign with Toleman than to retire from motorsport," Senna said.

        <strong>Ayrton Senna</strong> made his Formula 1 debut on March 25, 1984, at the Brazilian Grand Prix in the now-defunct Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro. He aimed to have a great race in his home country but retired on the eighth lap due to an engine failure. However, in his second race in South Africa, he finished sixth, earning his first point in F1—the first of 614.
        
        In his debut season in the premier motorsport category, Senna finished ninth in the championship with 13 points. His best result was a second place at the Monaco Grand Prix. Journalists of the time noted that Senna might have won had the race not been stopped due to heavy rain. In that race, Senna showcased his exceptional skill in wet conditions and his ability to drive at high speed on Monaco's narrow streets. Years later, Senna would be regarded as the "King of Monaco," with six victories in ten races there.</p>

        <p>In his second year in Formula 1, Senna left Toleman and signed with Lotus, where he raced for three years. The new team allowed him to compete for top positions and even victories.

        Senna's first Formula 1 victory came on April 21, 1985, at the Portuguese Grand Prix. It was raining heavily, and Senna once again demonstrated his exceptional skill on a wet track. The race was stopped with only nine cars remaining on the track, with Ayrton in first place.
        
        With Lotus, Senna achieved six victories: Portugal and Belgium in 1985; Spain and the United States in 1986; and Monaco and the United States in 1987. In the championship, he finished fourth in his first two years and third in his last year. In 1987, another Brazilian, Nelson Piquet, won the championship.</p>

        <h3 id="mclaren">Ayrton on McLaren</h3>
        <p>Senna achieved good results with Lotus but needed a bigger team to become a Formula 1 champion. At the time, the best cars were from McLaren and Williams, with Ferrari slightly behind. McLaren opened its doors to Senna, and he joined without hesitation. Both McLaren and Lotus used Honda engines, which facilitated the deal. While at Toleman and Lotus, Senna easily outperformed his teammates, but this changed at McLaren, where he joined alongside two-time world champion Alain Prost.

        By the end of 1989, the relationship between Senna and Prost became unsustainable within McLaren. Prost felt that team boss Ron Dennis favored Senna, so he moved to Ferrari. He was replaced by Austrian driver Gerhard Berger, who became Senna's best friend in Formula 1. Senna and Prost competed for the championship again in 1990, with Senna leading as they arrived in Japan. A double retirement would give Senna the title, which is exactly what happened when Senna forced a collision with Prost, taking both out of the race. This incident was seen as revenge for 1989.
        
        In 1991, Prost's Ferrari couldn't keep up with McLaren, allowing Senna to win the first four races, including an epic victory in Brazil. Despite gearbox problems and rain, Senna managed to finish, exhausted and barely able to lift the trophy. With Prost out of the title race, Senna's main rival became Nigel Mansell from Williams. At the penultimate race in Japan, Mansell's crash secured Senna's third title. At the finish line, Senna deliberately slowed down to let Berger win.
        
        Senna's victories and actions made him a national hero. In the late 1980s, Brazil was emerging from a military dictatorship and facing economic difficulties, with increased poverty and declining per capita income. Senna's displays of national pride, like parading with the Brazilian flag, and the media's portrayal of him, helped build his image as a national hero.
        
        In Formula 1, teams' performance can vary year to year due to changes in rules, aerodynamics, engines, mechanics, and electronics. In 1992, Williams had a superior car, and Senna couldn't defend his title, though he still won three races, including a defensive victory against Mansell in Monaco.
        
        In 1993, Alain Prost returned to replace Nigel Mansell, who had retired after winning the championship (though he would return for some races in 1994 and 1995). Senna won five races, but Prost won seven and claimed the championship. One of Senna's victories was at the European Grand Prix in Donington, England, where he delivered what is considered the best opening lap in history.</p>

        <h2 id="death">Senna's Death</h2>
        <p>Ayrton Senna wanted to be champion again and knew he had no more chances with McLaren. After Prost announced his retirement following his fourth title win, Senna joined Williams. Despite starting strong in the first two races, car issues forced Senna to retire from both, with Michael Schumacher winning them.

        In late April, Formula 1 arrived at the Imola circuit in San Marino for the third race of the season, which would become the most tragic in the sport's history. On Friday, Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello had a severe accident and was hospitalized. On Saturday, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger died in a crash during qualifying.
        
        The accidents left the drivers anxious, and Senna discussed increased safety measures with other drivers, even considering not racing. However, the race went ahead as planned.
        
        Senna knew he needed to win to stay in contention for the championship against Schumacher. He secured pole position in qualifying. During the race, Senna was leading with Schumacher close behind when, on the sixth lap, a steering column failure caused Senna to crash at the Tamburello corner at nearly 300 km/h. The impact caused fatal injuries, and Senna was pronounced dead on May 1, 1994.
        
        Senna's funeral took place on May 5, 1994, in São Paulo and lasted 22 hours. Around 240,000 people attended the procession, which was broadcast live on television. Senna's coffin was carried by fellow drivers, including Emerson Fittipaldi, Gerhard Berger, Alain Prost, Rubens Barrichello, and others.</p>
